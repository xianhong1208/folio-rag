# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Console login.** The `/admin` console now signs in with an MCP Gate access
  token for this service (`POST /api/console/session`). The token is verified
  offline once and exchanged for an HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict session cookie
  that carries only its identity (jti / sub / scopes), never the token. Scripts
  can call `/api/admin/*` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` instead.
  New settings `auth.console.{session_hours, session_secret, secure_cookie,
  admin_scope}`, all with defaults.
- **`rag:admin` scope.** Changing runtime settings, probing arbitrary endpoints,
  and reading the settings audit log and server-wide resources need it; without
  it Settings and System Health are read-only.

### Changed
- **The console is scoped to the signed-in token.** It shows and manages only
  the folders owned by the token's `jti` (the same ones REST / MCP callers with
  that token reach); folders it creates belong to it. The *Owner Token* field
  and the console's ability to act as any folder's owner are gone. Cross-folder
  views (overview, jobs, analytics) cover the whole server only for `rag:admin`.
- Settings changes are audited under the token's `sub`.
- Cookie-authenticated console writes require the `X-RAG-Console: 1` header and
  a same-origin `Origin` / `Referer` (CSRF protection).
- With `auth.enabled: false` the console stays open (dev mode) and the server
  logs a warning at startup.

### Fixed
- Retrying a file's indexing checked folder ownership but not that the file was
  in that folder.
- The chunk viewer no longer reads a file name from outside the folder.
- Eval reports, question sets and history are keyed by folder id: two owners'
  same-named folders used to share (and could read) each other's results.

### Removed
- **The legacy single-file console** (`/admin-classic`, `web/admin_console.html`
  and its loader `src/api/router/admin_page_html.py`). The React console at
  `/admin` is the only console.

### Changed
- **The authorization server is now called MCP Gate** (formerly MCP Center). Docs
  and log messages follow the new name; `src/auth/mcp_center_auth.py` is now
  `src/auth/mcp_gate_auth.py` and `McpCenterTokenVerifier` is
  `McpGateTokenVerifier`. Configuration and issued tokens are unaffected.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-09-18

### Added
- **Streaming answers (SSE)** in the Search Playground — the generated answer now
  streams token by token instead of blocking until the final token.
- **Multi-modal retrieval** — Docling-parsed tables are surfaced in retrieval
  results and rendered as real tables; the MCP `search` tool now includes
  `content_type` (`table`/`picture`) so an agent knows a hit is a table.
- **Evaluation depth** — LLM-graded answer quality (faithfulness + relevance) and
  a persisted baseline history / trend, plus stale-set auto-regeneration with
  `regenerate_reason` / `stale_dropped` notices.
- **One-click Rebuild-FTS** — re-segments existing chunks with CKIP and rebuilds
  only the keyword-search vector (no re-embedding), with an explanatory tooltip.
- **React admin console** as the front door (root redirects to `/admin`), a
  Settings **scrollspy**, an accessibility pass (keyboard-operable rows/tiles,
  labelled inputs, visible focus), themed floating tooltips, and frontend tests +
  CI.

### Fixed
- **Evaluation** — bound `n`/`k` on the run endpoint (guards a runaway/DoS run);
  never write an all-zero run to baseline history; compare the baseline delta
  against the *same* retrieval mode; keep a failed run's error visible;
  regenerate when a cached eval set is heavily stale.
- **Multi-modal** — the triplet-table parser no longer drops cells (float row
  labels, decimals, the final cell); rendered tables are no longer clamped into a
  tiny scroll box.
- **Search** — abort the SSE stream on navigation/unmount; fix SSE frame
  serialization and surface error frames.
- **Health** — the reranker check falls back to `/v1/models`, so a vLLM reranker
  no longer shows a misleading `HTTP 404`.
- **Console** — restart the file poll after upload/reindex (status refreshes
  without a manual reload); drop a stale files response after switching folders;
  retry instead of freezing on a transient load failure; format dates/numbers in
  en-US; keep the Status column stable during indexing; keep primary button labels
  on one line; fix uploads that silently did nothing; reject foreign-service tokens
  on folder create.
- **Ops** — disable the server's own core dumps by default; forward `force=`
  through the single-file indexing path.

### Notes
- The admin console is intentionally **English-only** (an i18n pass was added and
  then reverted during this cycle).

## [1.0.0]

- Initial release: Agentic RAG MCP server — hierarchical chunking + auto-merge,
  hybrid vector + BM25/CKIP retrieval, cross-encoder rerank, contextual retrieval,
  pgvector storage, per-token (`jti`) folder ownership, and the first React admin
  console.
